                <p class="p1">Dedicated to Emperor Meiji and his wife, Empress Shōken, construction of the splendid Meiji Shrine (Meiji Jingū) began in 1915 and was completed in 1926. Although the original structure was destroyed during WWII, it was rebuilt in 1958 and remains one of Tokyo's most important religious sites.

Surrounded by a 175-acre evergreen forest that is home to some 120,000 trees representing species found across Japan – as well as the interesting "wishing tree," on which visitors can write and hang their deepest wishes – the shrine's highlights include its Inner Precinct (Naien) with its museum containing royal treasures, and the Outer Precinct (Gaien).

It's in the Outer Precinct that you'll find the Meiji Memorial Picture Gallery with its superb collection of murals relating to the lives of the emperor and empress. Be sure to also visit the adjacent Meiji Shrine Inner Garden (Yoyogi Gyoen), an attractive public garden complete with a teahouse, iris garden, and a pleasant arbor.

                    <p class="p1">Walk through one of Tokyo's most historic pieces of land when you visit the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden. Formerly the residence of the Naito family during the Edo period (17th-19th centuries), it was transferred to the Imperial Family. It is now a national garden, which opened in 1949, and is considered to be one of the most beautiful in Japan.

                        The garden is considered one of the best because it fuses together three types of traditional garden: French Formal, English Landscape, and Japanese traditional. It also happens to be one of the best spots in Tokyo to view the cherry blossoms, as the garden has roughly 1,500 cherry trees. You'll also find Himalayan cedars, cypresses, and tulip trees. The garden is very popular in the autumn, when the leaves start to change to crimson and gold.
                        
                        Other features of the garden include a greenhouse, beautiful ponds, and several pavilions.
